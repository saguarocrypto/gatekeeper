/// Utility function to check if the program is paused.
/// 
/// This function attempts to load the pause state PDA and check if the program is paused.
/// If the pause state PDA doesn't exist, the program is considered unpaused (allows normal operation).
/// 
/// # Parameters:
/// - `pause_state_info`: AccountInfo for the pause state PDA
/// 
/// # Returns:
/// - `Ok(())` if the program is not paused or pause state doesn't exist
/// - `Err(GatekeeperError::ProgramPaused)` if the program is paused
/// 
/// # Security Features:
/// - Graceful handling of non-existent pause state (treats as unpaused)
/// - Clear error messaging for CPI callers
/// - Fails fast to minimize compute usage when paused
